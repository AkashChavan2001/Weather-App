# Weather-App
A weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides users with real-time weather data for a specific location. The app typically integrates a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
